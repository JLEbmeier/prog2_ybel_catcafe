/**
 * A purring feline overlord representing a cat in the cat caf√©.
 *
 * Implements {@link Comparable} to sort cats in a binary search tree by weight, using
 * name as a tiebreaker for equal weights.
 *
 *
 * Change: Originally, {@link #compareTo(FelineOverLord)} used only weight
 * ({@code weight - o.weight}), treating cats with equal weights as duplicates, which
 * prevented insertion (e.g., "Morticia" was skipped). Now, it compares names when weights
 * are equal, ensuring all cats are inserted.
 *
 *
 * @param name   name of the cat
 * @param weight weight of the cat
